# The power of fundamentals 

In my daily routine, I interact with a high quantity of engineers from the industry. It is interesting see how the system administrators changed their roles in the last 10-15 years. 

My first work experience in IT was in a data center company. In my first days, I had to learn a lot about network engineering from a big network with a high quantity of high performance routers, etc. 

During those years, the IT industry did not have the quantity of investment that we have today and we had completely different roles in enterprise perspective. 

The agile was not much applied yet and there were roles like Network engineer, Linux admin, Windows admin, Helpdesk, etc.

Despite these roles still exist in several companies, these roles were part of the software development process. The famous roles like cloud, platform, DevOps, site reliability engineers did not exist. 

I can say that the infrastructure professionals are already aware about career transition, automation and a completely change of your activities. I am not one developer, but it looks like that the developers don't know what is a career transition like this. 

In a day you need to stop/start in a daemon from Linux. In the day after, you need to use Ansible to configure your Kubernetes. Use GitOps. 

I would say that the former infrastructure engineers had to learn code, automation, Linux, network... That's a crazy change in my opinion.

There are engineers that are not good with coding, but they are troubleshoot masters. 

I can say that currently there are some DevOps engineers that are coding more than troubleshooting complex infrastructure issues. Some of them have a huge difficult to understand the pieces and prefer to delete everything and start from scratch again.
