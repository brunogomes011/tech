# The power of fundamentals 

In my daily routine, I interact with a high quantity of engineers of the industry. It is interesting see how the system administrators changed their roles in the last 10-15 years. 

My first work experience in IT was in a data center company. In those first steps, I had to learn a lot about network engineering from a big network with a high quantity of high performance routers, connections, companies, etc. 

During those years, the IT industry did not have the quantity of investment that it has today and we had completely different roles in enterprise perspective. 

The agile was not much applied yet and there were roles like Network engineer, Linux admin, Windows admin, Helpdesk, etc.

Despite these roles still exist in several companies, these roles were part of the software development process. The famous roles like cloud, platform, DevOps, site reliability engineers did not exist with the perspective.

I can say that the infrastructure professionals are already aware about career transition, automation and a completely change of your activities. I am not a developer, but it looks like that the developers don't know what is a career transition like this except specific programming language changes.

In a day you need to stop/start in a daemon from Linux. In the day after, you need to use Ansible to configure your Kubernetes. Apply GitOps architecture.

I would say that the former infrastructure engineers had to learn code, automation, Linux, network to continue working and get a good job. That's a crazy change in my opinion when you see the quantity of tools, coding and troubleshooting knowledge DevOps, SRE, etc needs to have nowadays.

There are engineers that are not good with coding, but they are troubleshoot masters. 

I can say that there are some DevOps engineers that are coding more than troubleshooting complex infrastructure issues. Some of them have a huge difficult to understand the pieces and prefer to delete everything and start from scratch again. That's a bad decision in my opinion, but we don't have any time, right?

This is my personal point of view of this giant market with several types of companies and roles. 

One interesting behavior that I see in most part of recruitment process is that in an ocean of possibilities, the companies prefer to hire people based on very tools, cloud provider flavors instead focusing on fundamentals, base knowledge. That's a very unproductive way to hire people in my opinion. They are losing good candidates and probably hiring some unskilled engineers.

I see in some hiring processes that the professional needs to know the DNS service from one cloud provider. How to use that web interface. Why don't ask if the professional knows the DNS fundamentals? 

If the HRs keeps finding professionals using very specific tools as reference... It is obvious that they would not have enough professionals for a high quantity of positions. 

This is a bad reaction for one market that invents one different tool or service to do something that already exists everyday. I think the engineers don't need to follow these rules. The engineers need to understand the fundamentals, the deep dive knowledge and not spending your studying hours in tools or certifications that won't be irrelevant for this pretty dynamic market. 

But, anyways, I'm only one drop in this big ocean.
